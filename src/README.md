Confidentiality Alert System.

This is Version 3, for Version 2 please refer to Repo https://github.com/AlexsCode/LoggingStation.

This project is to create an IoT alert system which can be attached to doors or windows. When a door or window is opened, the system sends an alert to a paired Desktop Client. Which then locks the screen covering all critical information.

ToDo:
GPIO Wake Function.
